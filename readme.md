<h1> Welcome to my pogram</h1>
  
_You are asked to input an integer_
  
**The program then checks if your input is a valid integer**
  
#Okay, but WHY?!
  
  _Only integers can be prime/composites. Any floating point number technically has infinite factors, blurring the whole concept_
    
**Then, it processes the input and uses a simple alogrithm to find all the pairs of that number**
  
**finally,it puts em all in a list ig and then prints em**
